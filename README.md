# HatSystem

Group project by six University students, focus being on developing according to Scrum. Developed in NetBeans with Java and Swing. The ER-modelling and MySQL script was made by the student group, the InfDB.jar was provided by the professor. We got a general description of the hat making business, and by having meetings with the client we collected the requirements along the way.

We mostly programmed in pairs, collaborating through Zoom, Discord and GitHub.

The system can be used by the hat making business to document and keep track of hats, orders and customers. The user can add an image to an order, and create pdf files with order confirmation and shipping invoice.

Standard hats are hats that they have a pattern for and that can always be made quick.
Custom hats use the pattern of a standard hat, but with a small twist to it.
Special hats are hats that cannot be made from a standard pattern.
